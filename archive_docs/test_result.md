# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}

##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Previously all events (player_joined, game_starting, game_finished) were broadcasting globally to ALL connected clients. This caused: 1) Players seeing events from other rooms 2) Winner modals repeating 3) Room participant lists not syncing properly. Solution: Implemented proper Socket.IO room management with room-specific broadcasting. socket_rooms.py module was already created but never imported/used - now fully integrated. User testing protocol: Start 2 different rooms (e.g. Bronze and Silver) with different players, verify events only reach room participants, winner modal appears exactly once to correct players, room participant updates happen in real-time."

user_problem_statement_OLD_1: "Optimize Solana transaction commitment from 'finalized' to 'confirmed' to reduce payment sweep confirmation delay from 3-5 minutes to ~10-30 seconds. Fix payment modal to close immediately after tokens are credited without waiting for sweep completion."

          comment: "OPTIMIZATION IMPLEMENTED: 1) Removed unused 'Finalized' import (line 20) 2) System was ALREADY using 'Confirmed' commitment everywhere - no change needed there 3) Captured last_valid_block_height from blockhash response (line 599) 4) Updated confirm_transaction to pass last_valid_block_height parameter (line 637) for proper timeout behavior. This ensures sweep confirmation properly times out after blockhash expiry (~60-90s) instead of waiting indefinitely. Expected impact: Faster sweep confirmation, proper timeout handling."

Previous logic had 3 states: 1) payment_detected && !tokens_credited (processing) 2) tokens_credited && !sol_forwarded (crediting - STUCK STATE) 3) tokens_credited (complete - never reached due to #2). New simplified logic has 2 states: 1) payment_detected && !tokens_credited (processing) 2) tokens_credited (complete - closes modal). Modal now closes immediately after tokens are credited, regardless of sweep status. Sweep happens in background transparently to user."

Root cause analysis revealed system was already using 'Confirmed' commitment (not 'finalized' as suspected). Real issues were: 1) Backend confirm_transaction not using last_valid_block_height for proper timeout 2) Frontend modal had faulty else-if logic preventing closure. Both issues now fixed. TESTING NOTE: There's a separate RPC authentication error (401 with Helius API key 'casinosol') that needs user attention - not related to these changes but may affect live testing. Please test: 1) Payment modal closes within 2 seconds after tokens credited 2) Sweep confirmation behaves properly with timeout 3) No hanging payment states."
